    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this section, we will focus on building **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** from **tabular data**. Specifically, we will use tables **S013** and **LFA1** from the **SPURCHASE** schema to construct an **ontology** that captures the semantic relationships between these tables. The ontology will define key aspects such as table relationships, join conditions, and relevant columns. This semantic layer serves as the foundation for generating knowledge graphs, enabling more meaningful data integration and querying. Once the ontology is created, we will import it into **SAP HANA Cloud** to generate the Knowledge Graphs. The import can be done either via a local file or through supported cloud storage options. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the ontology and knowledge graph in place, we aim to **answer complex business or analytical questions** that are grounded in underlying **tabular data** by leveraging the ontologies created and stored within the **SAP HANA Cloud database**. These ontologies provide a **semantic layer** that describes the structure, meaning, and relationships of the data in a machine-readable format, enabling more intelligent and context-aware data access. By using this semantic model—built from metadata such as table relationships, column meanings, and domain-specific concepts—we can translate user queries or application logic into meaningful insights, even when the data resides in multiple interrelated tables. This approach enhances data **discovery, reasoning, and integration**, and supports more intuitive querying through graph-based models rather than complex joins or manual interpretation of raw table structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the dataset\n",
    "This dataset is a **simulated version of vendor data** from **SAP S/4HANA**, created for demonstration purposes. It includes **vendor evaluation records (S013)** and **supplier master data (LFA1)**, which are essential for assessing vendor performance, identifying potential supply chain risks, and supporting data-driven procurement decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the demo calculation of risk score on table S013, we used the following weighting key (sums to 1.00):\n",
    "|Criterion (column)\t|Description\t|Weight |\n",
    "|-------------------|---------------|-------|\n",
    "|**PWMT1**\t|Quantity-reliability points\t|0.15|\n",
    "|**PWTT1**\t|On-time-delivery points\t|0.15|\n",
    "|**PWEV1**\t|Compliance with shipping instructions\t|0.10|\n",
    "|**PWWE1**\t|Service-quality points\t|0.15|\n",
    "|**PWFR1**\t|Service timeliness\t|0.10|\n",
    "|**PWQA1**\t|Quality-audit points\t|0.10|\n",
    "|**LAVI1**\t|Shipping-notification performance\t|0.15|\n",
    "|**ALAV1**\t|Variance from shipping notification\t|0.10|\n",
    "|**Total**\t|—\t|1.00|\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VENDOR_SCORE** = Σ( score × weight ) / 1.00  \n",
    "- **RISK_SCORE**   = 100 – VENDOR_SCORE\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: \n",
    "> - These weights are just an example. In a real SAP system they must mirror the weighting key defined in SPRO ▸ Materials Management ▸ Purchasing ▸ Vendor Evaluation ▸ Define Weighting Keys.\n",
    "> - If your system uses the standard key 000 (equal importance) you would set each weight to 0.125 (12.5 %) or simply average the eight criteria.\n",
    "> - Management dashboards often base the overall vendor rating on the “…2” values to avoid wild month-to-month swings.\n",
    "> - If you load true historical S013 data (several periods) into HANA, switching the formula to the “…2” fields will give exactly the same logic SAP uses in the standard report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG) using SAP HANA Knowledge Graph Engine\n",

    "Here are the typical steps to create a knowledge graph from tabular data in SAP HANA Cloud:\n",

    "1. **Extract Metadata from Tables**\n",
    "    - Extract metadata such as table and column names, data types, relationships (foreign keys), and constraints.\n",
    "    - Optionally, gather descriptions and aggregation rules if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the Ontology or Semantic Model**\n",
    "    - Create an ontology that represents the entities, attributes, and relationships based on the extracted metadata.\n",
    "    - Define classes (for tables/entities), properties (for columns/attributes), and relationships (joins or foreign keys).\n",
    "    - This semantic model forms the basis of the knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert Tabular Data into RDF Triples**\n",
    "    - Map rows and columns to RDF triples of the form (subject, predicate, object).\n",
    "    - Subjects typically represent entities (e.g., vendor records).\n",
    "    - Predicates represent attributes or relationships.\n",
    "    - Objects are values or related entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load RDF Triples into SAP HANA Cloud**\n",
    "    - Create tables or graph workspace structures in SAP HANA Cloud to hold RDF triples or graph data.\n",
